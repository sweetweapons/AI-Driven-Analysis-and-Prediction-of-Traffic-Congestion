This project uses machine learning to predict the congestion level based on various factors such as traffic volume, average speed, travel time index, weather factors, and more. By utilizing historical traffic data, the model helps predict future congestion levels and optimize traffic management.
Dataset

The dataset consists of traffic data with the following columns:

    Date: Date of the data entry.
    Area Name: Area where the traffic data was collected.
    Road/Intersection Name: The specific road or intersection.
    Traffic Volume: The number of vehicles passing through the road.
    Average Speed: Average speed of vehicles.
    Travel Time Index: Index indicating the time delay for travel.
    Congestion Level: The level of traffic congestion (target variable).
    Road Capacity Utilization: Utilization of the road capacity.
    Incident Reports: Incident reports affecting traffic.
    Weather Factor: Weather conditions affecting traffic.
    Other Features: Includes various factors like speed to capacity ratio, weather adjusted traffic volume, and more.

The data also includes features like Day_of_Week, Month, Year, and Is_Weekend to capture time-related patterns.

Machine Learning Model

We use a Random Forest Classifier to predict the congestion level of roads based on various features. The model is trained on historical data to capture the relationship between the features and the congestion level.
Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

    Accuracy: The percentage of correctly predicted congestion levels.
    Confusion Matrix: To visualize the performance of the classifier.
    Precision, Recall, F1-Score: For understanding the balance between false positives and false negatives.

Hyperparameter Tuning

To improve the model's performance, we perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like:

    Grid Search Cross-Validation: Exhaustive search over a set of hyperparameters.
    Randomized Search: Randomly selecting hyperparameters from a distribution.
    Bayesian Optimization: Optimizing hyperparameters based on past trials.

We used a combination of these methods to find the best-performing hyperparameters for the Random Forest Classifier.
Feature Importance

Feature importance is calculated to understand which features have the most significant impact on predicting congestion levels. This allows for optimization by removing unnecessary features.
